            <li>6 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 cups milk</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
            <li>½ cup hot sauce (such as Frank's® Redhot®), or more to taste</li>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
    </p>

    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>Remove the wings and legs from the rotisserie chicken, discarding the skin and bones. Chop or shred the dark meat into bite-sized pieces.</li>
            <li>In a large Dutch oven, melt the butter over medium heat. Gradually whisk in the flour until a thick paste forms, cooking until golden, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Pour in the milk, whisking constantly until thickened and bubbling, about 5 minutes. Continue to cook and stir until the sauce is smooth, about 1 minute more. Reduce heat and season with black pepper.</li>
            <li>Stir in the shredded Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses until melted and well combined.</li>
            <li>Add the hot sauce to the cheese sauce, adjusting the amount to your desired level of spiciness.</li>
            <li>Stir in the gorgonzola cheese, chicken, and cooked macaroni, mixing well to combine.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
