        <h2>Directions</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove the stems and seeds from the dried guajillo, ancho, and pasilla chiles. In a dry skillet over medium heat, toast the chiles for 2-3 minutes until fragrant. Be careful not to burn them. Place the toasted chiles in a bowl and cover them with hot water. Let them soak for about 15-20 minutes until softened.</li>
            <li>Drain the chiles and transfer them to a blender. Add the quartered onion, minced garlic, beef broth, apple cider vinegar, cumin, oregano, black pepper, and salt to the blender. Blend until smooth.</li>
            <li>In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat a small amount of oil over medium-high heat. Add the beef chuck roast and brown it on all sides (about 4-5 minutes per side). Pour the blended sauce over the browned beef, making sure to coat it well.</li>
            <li>Add enough beef broth to cover the meat (about 2 cups). Bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it cook for 3-4 hours until the beef is tender and easily shredded.</li>
            <li>Once cooked, remove the beef from the pot and shred it using two forks. Return the shredded beef to the pot and stir to combine with the sauce.</li>
            <li>In a separate skillet, heat the corn tortillas over medium heat until warm and pliable. Fill each tortilla with the beef mixture and top with shredded cheese.</li>
            <li>Serve the tacos with chopped onions, cilantro, and lime wedges on the side. Enjoy!</li>
