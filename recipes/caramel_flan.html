        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    </p>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 (8-ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>5 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
            <li>In a small saucepan, cook the sugar over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally until it turns golden. Pour the caramel into a 10-inch round baking dish, tilting to coat the bottom and sides, and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, and vanilla until smooth.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture into the caramel-coated baking dish.</li>
            <li>Line a roasting pan with a damp kitchen towel and place the baking dish inside. Fill the roasting pan with boiling water to reach halfway up the sides of the baking dish.</li>
            <li>Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, until the center is just set. Cool on a wire rack for 1 hour, then refrigerate for at least 8 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>To unmold, run a knife around the edges of the baking dish and invert onto a rimmed serving platter.</li>
        </ol>
